Thanks for stopping by and for your interest in learning a bit more about me.  If you want a high level look into what I do and how I work then I suggest you take a look at [my setup](http://mstrick.com/my-setup/).

## I am not there yet..

About pages, bios and things of the like are always hard to write. On the one hand you want to communicate who you are but at the same time they can often appear to be self aggrandizing.

But if you could know one thing about me then let it be this: I am not there yet. I am a work in progress, we all are right?

I am working on [my craft](http://idlefusion.com) and focusing on helping others.

## A little more...

I am follower of Jesus. I am husband to Katie and a father to Ella and Jad. I am a [doorholder](http://passioncity.com). I enjoy blogging about my faith, family, technology and [sports](http://georgiadogs.com).

By day and sometimes night, I am a Developer working on building mostly web and mobile products. Some tools I use are [Objective-C / iOS](http://developer.apple.com), [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) and [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

Some of you may have arrived here because you use [Gitty.](http://gittyapp.com) Thank you for your support and helping make Gitty the best GitHub app for iOS.

If you are interested in hiring me to work on your project, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:matthew@idlefusion.com).
