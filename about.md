# Hey!
<hr>

I am Matthew, a Software Engineer living in Atlanta, Georgia. I work for <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> building iOS Apps and do freelance on the side. Most days you can find me writing Swift, Objective-C and Ruby.

# Apps
<hr>

Below are some of the apps I have worked on. Some were for my previous employer <a href="http://vertigo.com">Vertigo</a>, while others were under my own personal company <a href="http://idlefusion.com">Idle Fusion</a>. If you are interested, check out this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=203683539">complete list of apps.</a>
