Four years ago my life changed forever when we welcomed Ella Reese Strickland into the world. Not only did I become a dad, but I fell in love again all over.

## A few things I will never forget...

* I will never forget that moment when the doctor lifted you out of his hands and into mine.

* I will never forget the first time our eyes met.

* I will never forget the feeling that you knew my voice when I first told you I loved you.

## A few things I hope you will never forget...

* You are loved and have extreme value because you were created in God's image.

* Your dreams are just a glimpse at what can be if you have the conviction that they must be.

* Your mark on this world may be measured in many ways but I hope the greatest is how you loved others.

Love you Ella, Happy Birthday :)

Daddy
