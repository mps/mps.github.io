Jon Reid:

> My initial motivation for exploring DI came from doing test-driven development, because in TDD you constantly wrestle with the question of “How do I write a unit test for this?” But I discovered that DI is actually concerned with a bigger idea: that our code should be composed of modules that we snap together to build an application.

Testing iOS Applications can be difficult.  This is a great article on Dependency Injection and I personally favor 'Property Injection' in my day to day use.
