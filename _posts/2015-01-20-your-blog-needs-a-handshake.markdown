If you are visiting the site today, you may have notice a little bit of change to the layout.  I decided to switch things up a bit from a more blog centric landing page to what I am calling a handshake landing page.

Before:

Your typical blog has a menu and some posts.  The design is setup so that when the user lands on the site, they already know what to do.  For some this is perfectly fine but I have often wondered what if my site became a little more introductory in its prose.  Instead of a menu and some posts, how about a greeting and then some info about me.  Sure it will have links to my blog posts but let's not get too forward.
