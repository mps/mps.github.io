About the only good thing you might be able to say is that the magnitude of the financial failure isn’t quite as depressing as some other apps which sometimes make nothing even though they deserve much better.

Yes, the app is far from being an ADA winner and it needs to be much better, but the feedback from users was genuinely positive, and I received many kind words that still makes me smile. 

There have been a few other developers who recently shared their experiences [here](http://blog.jaredsinclair.com/post/93118460565/a-candid-look-at-unreads-first-year) and [here](http://txt.jazzychad.net/gist/19a05ad4e7ef77072b44) as well.

The real truth here is that App Developers need to have sober thoughts when it comes to making money from their Indie Apps.  True, there are some Developers who hit the big pay day but that is the exception, not the norm.  A better approach would be to try and create 10 apps that bring in $100 in revenue each per month instead of 1 app bringing in $1000 in revenue per month.

In the future, I plan to disclose some information about [Gitty](http://gittyapp.com).  Stay Tuned!
