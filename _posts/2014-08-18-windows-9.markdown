Windows 9 is huge for Microsoft and it is coming soon.  Windows 7 was a tremendous success following the lackluster Windows Vista release.  And just as much as they needed Windows 7, I think they need Windows 9 to refine the experience that 8 lacked and provide solid footing for their PC customers.

It also appears that Microsoft will follow Apple's lead and make the preview available to the public prior to release.
