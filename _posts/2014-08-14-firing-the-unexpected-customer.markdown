My friend Derick recently started an awesome [podcast hosting service called Signal Leaf](http://signalleaf.com) and today he shared some insight on having to fire his favorite customer:

> Everyone talks about the toxic customers… the ones that complain all the time, take up all your resources, demand free things in exchange for not complaining, and generally make your life as a business person hell. It’s relatively easy to fire the toxic customer, I think. I’ve done it a few times as a consultant, and it gets easier over time at least. 
>
> But there’s one thing that no one ever talks about… something that I’ve come to think of as the 2nd worst email that your business will ever send:

> Firing the customer that you love.

Pretty tough decision to face, but Derick elaborates on how he handled the situation and what others should do if and when they might be presented with this curious scenario.
