I received an email from Apple today announcing commissions using Store Kit via their iTunes Affiliate program.  Details:

> **Store Kit Product Sheet**
> 
> We are excited to announce that Store Kit Product Sheet is now affiliate commissionable on iOS 8.
Store Kit Product Sheet allows app developers to promote the purchase of music, apps, books and more directly from a sheet within your app and earn the standard affiliate commission on all sales within 24 hours.
> 
> We encourage you to use Store Kit Product Sheet to provide a superior user experience and keep users in your app longer. Learn how to integrate your affiliate token into the Store Kit Product Sheet in the Developer Documentation.

Unsure how much revenue this will generate for me personally, but I am sure there are some developers who are excited about this.
