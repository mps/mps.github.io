Trust is huge. I could argue it is one of, if not the most important characteristics no matter the context.  Without it, relationships breakdown, life becomes a series of questions and work is impossible.

So you may be asking yourself, "Yeah Matthew, we know trust is important, what gives?"  Well today I am going to make a case for a <strong>"Trust First"</strong> model when it comes to the way you and I live our lives.

## A little context

You see, for most of us we work in companies where trust is <strong>earned</strong> not <strong>given</strong>. Some will stand by this principle.  They will say, "prove yourself and then I will trust you."  How messed up is that?

At what point in this person's career will trust be fully earned?

If you are hiring someone who you cannot trust day one then perhaps your hiring strategy needs to change.

&nbsp;

## Why this is important

In a <strong>"Trust First"</strong> model people are empowered to do the things we have hired them to do because we trust them.  We trust them to make the best decision for the company,<strong> from day one</strong>.

&nbsp;

## Where do we go from here?

Trust

Often when companies make new hires, there is this evaluation period. During this time, employees spend their time getting acclimated to the company, their systems and "earning their keep." While most are unaware, the message these companies are sending is one of distrust.
