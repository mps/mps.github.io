Daniel Thomas and Tim Bradshaw for the FT.com:

> Almost a third of smartphone users do not download any apps for their devices in a typical month, according to a report by Deloitte that predicts the volume of app store sales is hitting a ceiling.
>
> Almost nine in 10 people also say that they never spend money on apps or other smartphone content. 

Articles like this, reports from other Developers and my own experiences make me scared for the smaller App Developers out there.  Even my dad, who has owned an iPhone since the 3S, has yet to purchase an App other than Pages.

Even as I examine my own behavior, I am not downloading Apps today at the pace I was between 2007-2010.

I hope Apple offers iTunes Gift Cards with iOS Device purchases soon to hopefully super charge the App purchasing environment.
