> The most common trap here is the early iOS app which gets some buzz. All of a sudden, the founders hear “When are you building for Android?” The natural, enthusiastic response to sincere requests of the Android chorus is to go ahead and build for Android and seek more downloads, more growth, more revenue. I have a different view though. The proper response is: “No. Buy an iPhone.” 

I often get asked when [Gitty](http://gittyapp.com) will be available for Android.  This will now be my answer.  Unless of course I choose to learn another platform.
