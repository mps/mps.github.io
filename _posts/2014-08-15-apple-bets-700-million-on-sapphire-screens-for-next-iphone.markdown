 Daisuke Wakabayashi for the Wall Street Journal:

> Apple Inc. created the blueprint for a smartphone when it covered the touch screen of its first iPhone in glass instead of plastic. Now, it is betting $700 million that sapphire, a harder and more expensive material, can replace glass and better protect future devices.
>
> The first sapphire display screens for the forthcoming larger iPhone and smartwatch are expected to roll off production lines this month...

Harder to break screens will make everyone happier.
