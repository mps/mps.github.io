> It seems clear that, at least on the US App Store, white is objectively a very common app icon color. In some categories (Finance-Paid, Food&Drink-Paid, Lifestyle-Free) white is even the most common solid color background.

For [Gitty 2](http://gittyapp.com) I went with a black background and white text to try and stand out.  It seems that most major media apps I work on these days are trending towards white backgrounds with color text and graphics.
