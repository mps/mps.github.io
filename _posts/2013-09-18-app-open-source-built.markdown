Last evening, I was fortunate enough to be able to speak at the [Atlanta iOS Developers Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/iosatlanta/events/104522872/).  The talk centered around how I created [Gitty](http://gittyapp.com) leveraging Open Source.  I spent some time trying to advocate for Open Source in iOS Development and for others to give back.  Thanks to everyone who came out and for the kind words.  

If you would like to see my slides you can view them on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/strickland/the-app-open-source-built).  Please feel free to ask questions in the comments if you were unable to chat with me last night.
