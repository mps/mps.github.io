As a frequent user of Twitch, I for one am really excited to see a company like Amazon get behind the brand and idea.  E-Sports has been on the rise in America and and will soon be a force to reckon with when it comes to traditional television.  It is undeniable the amount of 18-25 male eyeballs that Twitch has.  Great move Amazon.
