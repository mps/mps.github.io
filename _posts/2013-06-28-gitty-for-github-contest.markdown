Today marks six weeks since the release of [Gitty for GitHub](http://gittyapp.com) and to celebrate, I am giving away a free copy of Gitty to one lucky reader.

If this is the first time you are hearing about Gitty, then here's a list of some features you can expect:

* Gitty allows you to easy see and read GitHub notifications with the deep linking you have come to expect.

## Repositories, Users and Organizations

* Beautiful User and Organization profiles

## Search and Explore GitHub

Releasing Gitty was both a labor of love and joy.  There is no better feeling than creating something and having people find value in it.  I keep telling people that the best experience is not any money I make off of Gitty but the hundreds of people who have sent encouraging messages to me about how Gitty helps make their life easier and their development experience better.
