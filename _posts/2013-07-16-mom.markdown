Today is my Mom's birthday and this post is dedicated to her.

## Earliest Memories

One of my earliest and most endearing memory of my mom came when I was 8 years old. I played baseball in a league higher than my age with 9 and 10 year olds.  My dad made that call because he wanted me to face live pitching instead of another year hitting off of a tee.

It was our first game, new uniform (we were the Mariners) and I was ready to go.  Being smaller than the other kids, my dad decided to put me lower in the lineup and play me at second base even though I would go on to play just about every position and bat 3rd later in life.  That day we were facing some stiff competition.  The pitcher, a 10-year-old, was arguably one of the better players in the league and mainly due to his size.  Next to me, he looked like a grown man.

When it came time for me to bat, I dug my cleats into the batters box, kicked a few pieces of dirt around and stepped out to get the sign from my dad down the third base line...I was ready.  What happened next is pretty funny looking back on it but it was devastating when it happened.  The very first pitch of the at bat was coming in hard and high, right for my head.  By the time I tried to duck, the ball was already on me and sure enough, I took a baseball right to the mouth.  Talk about a great way to start the season.

My dad came rushing into the batters box and I can remember hearing my mom shriek from the crowd.  After that, my dad subbed me out and let me sit the rest of the game with my mom in the stands.  Sure that sounds wimpy but in that moment, I just wanted the pain to go away and to know it was going to be alright and I found that comfort in the arms of my mom.

## Lasting Character

You see, that's the way my mom is, not just for me but for anyone.  She is the kind of woman who will open her arms wide, give you a big hug and let you know that everything is going to be alright.

She's the kind of mom that is always there, always calls to check in and always knows the right things to say and when to listen.

She's the kind of person that views life as a series of opportunities and blessings, not a series of obstacles and burdens.

I have seen my mom endure great pain in the past few years with the loss of her mom and brother.  Through it all she remains her positive, upbeat self, relying on the truth from her heavenly father to guide her.

## Dear Mom

Mom, I love you.  You mean the world to me.  If I could choose any mom in the world, I would choose you every time.

It's the little things you do in life that echo and those are the things I will always cherish about you.

Continue to love God, pursue him daily and let him define you.

Your Son,

Matthew
