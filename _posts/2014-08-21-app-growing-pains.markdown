Tim Bradshaw for FT.com:

> Back in 2008 or 2010, developers say, the best apps rose to the top of the charts – even those that charged a dollar or two. Now, with millions of apps to choose from, the stores are dominated by those companies that can afford to invest heavily in online advertising. 
> 
> In the last year, there hasn’t been a single real blockbuster app and every other app has a drastically reduced lifespan.

Tim describes the current ecosystem pretty well for apps.  Gone are the days where a simple app would race up the charts to multi-million dollar stardom.  It is increasingly difficult to make a living creating apps for sale in the app store.  Today, most developers make their money building apps for large media companies.
