## Why iPad?

Ever since I [released Gitty for GitHub](http://mstrick.com/gitty-for-github/) back in May, the #1 question I get is "when will the iPad version be out?" Well friends, today is that day.

All along, I have wanted to create an iPad version of Gitty. I felt there was a definite need to create a great [GitHub](http://github.com) experience on the iPad.

With Gitty on the iPad, it is everything you love about GitHub but for the iPad. Instead of having to interact with a web browser, you can enjoy a full native experience as you browse your Issues, Code, Repositories and Activity.

## In the Pipeline

While the iPad version was just released yesterday and [Version 1.2](https://github.com/mps/GittyFeedback/blob/master/handsetupdates.md) for the iPhone and iPod Touch was made available on Tuesday, a new update for both versions is almost ready to be shippped.

Here is a peek at what is to come:

### Gists

* Gitty now supports Gists, viewing your favorite Gists is just a tap away.
* Share your gists.

### Commits

* Gitty offers better support for viewing commit diffs. No longer do you have to look at tiny boxes of rendered code, the height of each box should be match the height of the file.

### Code Viewing

* You can now view your code in landscape mode.

### Updates

* Keep up to date with the latest changes for Gitty right inside of the app.

## Screenshots

Here are a few screenshots of what Gitty looks like for the iPad:

## Parting thoughts

I hope you enjoy Gitty for the iPad as much as I do. Today is just the beginning of its adventure but I am already thrilled with the product it is. [Get your copy today](http://my.mstrick.com/gittyipad) and let me know your feedback in the comments.

Thanks!
