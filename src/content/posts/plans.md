As we begin to turn the chapter on what was 2011, if you are anything like me then you start to reflect on what the previous year brought.

For some it was the failed resolutions - the weight you gained instead of lost, the plan you failed to stick to or the big dream that turned into a terrible nightmare. No matter the scenario, it is very easy to get discouraged when things do not turn out the way you had hoped.

Like a great shot of espresso, the new year brings about a jolt energy because we can all just start over. We can dream new dreams, plan even bigger plans and yes desire to lose those extra 10-15 pounds that we’ve stowed away for the winter.



But for many these things just scratch the surface, this failing goes a little bit deeper. The idea of not losing weight seems silly when faced with your dilemna. You dreamed big, you fell flat on your face and you feel that you have missed your one chance. Trust me I have been there.

As a follower of Christ, just when I think I have missed out on God’s plan for my life I am reminded of this verse:

"For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope."

-Jeremiah 29:11

I love that God chose to make the word plan plural. I cherish the truth that God does not just have one plan for my life but many plans.

So as you embark on what will be a new year with new beginnings, I encourage you to embrace the truth that God is the God of many plans. No matter the circumstance you are in, no matter how daunting the task may be, God is there with you and he has a plan even bigger and better that the one that failed. Our response is to just surrender and humble ourselves as God begins to let us in on what that new plan will be.
