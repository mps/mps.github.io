Last night I had the wonderful opportunity of speaking at a [local user group](http://www.meetup.com/Gwinnett-Microsoft-Users-Group/events/96829942/) about iOS Development from a .NET Developer's prospective. iOS Development can be pretty intimidated, but last's night goal was to encourage everyone to give it a shot with some nice steps of making that easier.
