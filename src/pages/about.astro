        I'm Matthew Strickland, a software engineer and engineering leader based in Atlanta, Georgia.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I work on International at <a href="https://chick-fil-a.com">Chick-fil-A</a>,
        building software to support the company's global expansion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Previously, I led the iOS and Web engineering teams at <a href="https://bignerdranch.com">Big Nerd Ranch</a>,
        where I helped organizations launch successful applications. Before that, I worked at
        Vertigo (now Disney Streaming Services), building apps used by millions of people.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love serving others through technology — helping teams grow, shipping products that matter,
        and writing about what I learn along the way.
